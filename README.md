# Simple-3D-Renderer
3D Renderer as an Application on 3D Graphics Chapter 

# What i've learned
- How 3D rendering works in games.
- Basic matrices algebra and how to use it to transform from coordinate system to another.
- Transform matrices and how to calculate them (worldTransform matrix , view-projection matrix). 
- How do cameras work in a 3D game.
- How to write Basic vertex shader and Basic fragment shader.
- What are meshes and how to deal with them.
- What are textures and how to deal with them.
- Phong model and how to apply it to my scene. 

# Notes
- used a pre-made math library provided with the book.
- used JSON as a mesh file format because it is easy to edit and used 
  rapidjson library to parse it.
